# leetcode-cpp
leetcode.com online judge questions practiced with C++, with test cases. The purpose of this repository is to track and post the solutions I have come up with. These are primarily for recruiters to see sample code but can be used by anyone to learn. Feel free to drop me an email at zakishaheen@me.com if you find a discrepency. 

The codes are divided in algo and DB. Following Algorithm questions have been implmented so far:

# Algorithm
- Excel Sheet Column Number (general mathematical relation finding)
- factorial trailing zeros (mathematical relation finding)
- find peak element (play with arrays)
- jump game 2 (recursion, maximization, this code needs optimisation with memoization) 
- majority element (simple use of data structures)


# DB
- coming soon
